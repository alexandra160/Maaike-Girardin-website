# Maaike-Girardin-website

During my last semester of my first year, the project was to develop a website for an upcoming artist.
Because we were working with a real client, in the beginning we had many meetings with her, where we got to know her, what she expected from us, as well as who are the people who listen to her music.

When we had all this information, we started with following the research process. It was a tricky task, as we found out that people don't usually visit artist's websites, exceptions can be when they want to buy merch for them - which was not the case for our client. So, we had to find ways in which we could create an interactive product, that people wanted to interact with. 

We did market research, and found out that many of these websites don't have anything personal to them. It was my idea to create a "tree of life", combing both her love for nature and her personal achivments in her musical career. 
The prototype was created in Adobe XD, but because we were short on time, we moved on with making changes after the testing directly on the coded product. 

At the final presentation, the client liked our product, as well as the teacher. Unfortunately, she did not end up choosing our website in the end, but for me it was a valuable experience, where I learned more about the process of creating a product - from the importance of user research and all its steps, to creating a user interface that is both easy to use and satisfies the client.
